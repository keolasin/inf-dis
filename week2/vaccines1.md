# Vaccines - basic concepts

## Learning Objectives

- Name the infectious diseases for which licensed vaccines exist
- Describe 3 major categories of vaccine formulations and their advantages and disadvantages
- List the licensed live, attenuated vaccines and describe why it is important to be attentive to this category of vaccines
- Describe how adjuvants augment the efficacy of a vaccine

## Concept of Infectious Disease Prevention

African Health Care Worker on disease prevention & Vaccines:

1. Ideally, you shouldn't be exposed,
2. If exposed, you shouldn't be infected,
3. If infected, you shoudln't get sick,
4. If you get sick, you shouldn't get too sick
5. If you get very sick, you shouldn't die, but,
6. If you die, you shouldn't be dieing young.

## Vaccines

**Definition**: a biological substance that stimulates a host's immune system to resist infections or cancer

- Vaccines against cancer:
  - Human papilloma virus (HPV), can cause cervical cancers
  - HepB virus (HBV), causes hepatocellular carcinoma

### History

1022: smallpox crusts shown to protect - variolation, injecting these crusts/pustules into people to give some protection

- "Vaccine" comes from variolae vaccinia, or cowpox
- First smallpox vaccine used by Jenner

Important Date: May 8, 1980

- man contracted smallpox naturally, and was the last individual ever to contract smallpox naturally

Early vaccines:

- vaccines prepared by isolation, inactivation, and attenuation of causative agent
- Rabies vaccine (Pasteur): 1885
  - virus grown in rabbit brain tissue
  - caused autoimmune disease
- Polio vaccine
  - old oral vaccine: Paralytic polio (1.1/1 million doses)
  - Cutter incident (1955): (happened in Berkeley), inactivated vaccine not fully inactivated (120,000 doses) - 60 polio cases among vaccinated children, 89 family contacts; 5 deaths.

### Vaccine formulations

1. Live attenuated vaccines
2. Inactivated whole cell or whole organism vaccines
3. subunit vaccines
4. "Naked DNA"

#### Licensed bacterial vaccines

1. live attenuated vaccine
   - Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis- BCG), not a very good vaccine, but does not cause disease in humans
   - Typohid (Salmonella typhi Ty21a), oral vaccine, mutations introduced to induce immune response without disease
2. Inactivated, whole organism vaccine
   - Cholera
   - Pertussis
   - Plague
   - Typhoid (Salmonella typhi)
3. Subunit vaccines
   - Pneumococcal diseases
   - Typohid
   - Hemophilus influenza b diseases
   - Pertussis
   - Meningococcal diseases
4. Conjugate Vaccines
   - polysaccharides that are conjugated to a protein carrier, 
   - H. influenza b
   - Pneumococcus
5. Toxoids
   - inactivated toxins to protect against disease
   - Tetanus (Clostridium tetani)
   - Diphtheria (Corynebacterium Diphteriae)

#### Licensed viral vaccines

1. Live attenuated vaccines
   - Can still cause disease in immunocompromised individuals
   - Polio (OPV)
   - Measles
   - Yellow Fever
   - Mumps
   - Rubella
   - Varicella (chickenpox)
2. Inactivated, whole organism vaccine
   - Influenza
   - Rabies
   - Japanese encephalitis
   - Polio (IPV)
   - Hepatitis A
3. Subunit vaccines
   - Hepatitis B
   - Influenza

### Advantages & Disadvantages of current vaccine development

1. Live attenuated vaccines:
   - Advantages
     - highly effective, 
     - long lasting
   - Disadvantages
     - difficult to grow
     - safety concerns
     - more side effects
2. Inactivated Vaccines
   - Advantages
     - easy to make
   - Disadvantages
     - difficult to grow
     - short-lasting effect
3. Subunit Vaccines
   - Advantages
     - safe
     - fewer side effects
   - Disadvantages
     - labor intensive to make
     - short-lasting effect
4. Conjugate Vaccines
   - Advantages
     - can enhance protective immunogenicity
   - Disadvantages
     - technically more demanding to make
     - too many capsule types
     - capsules may not be immunogenic

### Vaccine Adjuvants

A substance, when added to a vaccine, will enhance the immunogenicity of an antigen

Uses of adjuvants

- Enhance the immunogenicity of antigens
  - recruit specific immune cells to site of immunization
    - induction of Th1 vs Th2 response
    - enhance generation of memory cells
  - Activation of immune cells to create an inflammatory environment
  - Help mature antigen presenting cells to take up and present antigens in lymphoid tissues
- Can help to reduce the amount or number of antigens needed to elicit an effective immune response
- Can improve vaccine efficacy in newborns, elderly, or immunocompromised persons
- Can facilitate delivery of antigens in the mucosa

#### Licensed Adjuvants

- Alum (aluminum hydroxide): worldwide
- MPL (monphosphoryl lipid A - detoxified LPS): approved only with certain type of licensed vaccines, HPV (Cevarix)
- MF59 (Novartis): Europe only

##### Aluminum Hydroxide

- most widely used adjuvant
- No depot effect
- relatively safe
- enhances antigen presentation by APCs - increases antigen uptake and reduces antigen degradation
- Enhances Th2 response (IgG1 isotype, IgE)
- Unable to stimulate cell-mediated immune response
- Poorly immunostimulatory for polysaccharide antigens

### Vaccine Target Priorities

- Children
- Healthy adults
- Pregnant women
- Elderly
- Cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals
- Drug-resistant bacterial pathogens
- People in poverty
