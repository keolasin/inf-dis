# Immunological Concepts and Introduction

## Learning Objectives

- name the 2 components of the human immune system
- Explain the relevance of immunology to infectious disease and public health
- describe the importance of immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases.
- describe disorders associated with disruption of the normal immune system.

## Immune System

"Rule of 2"

1. innate immunity
    - what you're born with
2. acquired immunity
    - humoral immunity
        - B cells
        - Plasma cells
    - cell-mediated immunity
        - cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells)
        - helper T cells (CD4+ T cells)
            - Th1
            - Th2
            - Treg
            - Th17

### Components of innate immunity

1. Mechanical and physical barriers

    - skin and epithelial cells
    - secretions

2. Cells

    - phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells)
    - natural killer (NK) cells

3. Proteins

    - pattern-recognition receptors
    - complement system
    - cytokines and chemokines
    - other plasma proteins

### Components of acquired immunity

What you acquire after you're born

1. Humoral immunity
2. Cell-mediated immunity

#### Humoral Immunity

Immunoglobulin (antibody)

- consists of heavy chain and light chain, y-shaped structure
- specific form of the antibody recognizes certain antigens/microbes
- Fc domain attaches to immune cells (heavy chains), light chains attach to antigens

Antigens: molecule that elicits an antibody response against itself; antigen recognized by antibody to be foreign.

Highlights:

- Immunoglobulins are the main effector molecules of the humoral immune system
- immunoglobulins recognize peptides (linear chain of amino acids), polysaccharides, lipids
- immunoglobulins **cannot** enter cells. Therefore, it can only recognize extracellular microbes.

##### Where do antibodies come from?

Originate in the bone marrow, immature B cells made in the bone marrow, then move to the lymph nodes/tissue and become activated

In the lymph tissue, become plasma cells that then create antibodies; these antibodies recognize specific antigens

##### Types of immunoglobulins

**IgG** protect against bacteria, viruses; enhance phagocytosis; neutralize toxins (crosses placental barrier)
**IgA** protects against infection on mucous membranes
**IgM** protects against early phase of infection; can lyse microbes; receptor for activation of B cells
**IgD** serves as receptors for activation of B cells
**IgE** involved in allergic responses; triggers release of histamine

##### Relevance of Humoral response to infectious disease diagnosis

**Primary response**: Exposure occurs, then a lag period (~5 days), with initial IgM response, then IgG response with total antibody concentration increases and plateaus around 15 days.

**Secondary response**: re-exposure occurs, then milder IgM but much larger IgG and total antibody response peaking around 12 days, then tapers off

Obtaining serum levels at early stages of infection can help identify stage of infection and acuity.

- would need to demonstrate IgG increases over period of infection (multiple samples) to say someone was recently or acutely effective, especially if IgG changes by 4-fold.

##### Relevance of humoral immune response to vaccinology

- Level of antibody response can be used as a measure of efficacy of a vaccine (correlate of protection)
- type of antibody response can be used to predict which type of antigen is protective.
  - e.g., antibody against choleratoxin is protective, HIV is not protective

#### Cell-mediated immunity

##### Components

- Immature T-cells (made in bone marrow)
- Mature T cells (thymus)
- Activated T cells (lymphoid tissues)
  - CD4 or helper T cells: Th1 or Th2 subtypes:
    - activate other cells (B cells, T cells)
  - CD8 or killer or cytotoxic T cells
  - CD25 or regulatory T cells

##### Highlights

- T-lymphocytes eliminate intracellular microbes
- T cells recognize two types of intracellular microbes - those residing in a phagosomal compartment and those residing in the cytoplasm.

##### Pathway

Anitgen Presenting Cell (APC):

1. bacteria gets taken into phagosomal compartment of cell (phagocytosis)
2. Lysosomes fuse with a phagosome and release digestive enzymes that destroy the bacterium, producing antigens
3. Antigens are released into cytoplasm and cell-surface via MHC molecules
4. T-cells bind to the antigens on the APC

##### Relevance of cell-mediated immunity to infectious disease diagnosis

- Skin test for TB, leishmaniasis (CD4 T cells involved)
  - the antigens are injected subcutaneously, then CD4 T-cells recognize those antigens, produce inflammatory cytokines
- interferon-gamma release assay (e.g., QuantiFERON test) to diagnose latent TB infection
  - draw blood, separate plasma, expose antigens to the blood, measure cytokine response via gamma-interferons

## Disorders of the immune system

### Diminished Responses

1. acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS, DM, chemotherapy)
2. inherited disorders

### Aberrant responses

1. Autoimmunity
    - failure of T cells or B cells to distinguish self from non-self antigens
    - **Examples**: rheumatic heart disease, reactive arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome
2. Allergy
    - exaggerated responses of the immune system to a particular antigen (allergen)

### Inherited immune defects

1. Defects in antibody production (humoral):
   - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (more common in males, lack of gammaglobulins)
   - Hyper IgM immunodeficiency (increased IgG levels, normal or elevated IgM)
2. Defects in phagocytic cells:
   - leukocyte adhesion deficiency
   - chronic granulomatous disease
3. Defects in T cell function (cell-mediated):
   - X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency
   - MHC Class II deficiency
   - Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
