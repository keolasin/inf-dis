# Pertussis Resurgence and Vaccination

"Whooping Cough"

## Learning Objectives

- why has pertussis had a resurgence and what can be done about it?

## Pertussis - clinical spectrum

- Incubation period between 0-3 days,
- Catarrhal stage (coughing, URI), lasting 1-2 weeks
- Paraoxysmal stage (sudden explosive episodes of coughing, become SOB, can cause hemorhagging, can cause infant death, whooping noise)
- Convalescent stage

Disease caused by Bordatella pertussis

- highest incidence in infants, along with morbidity/mortality
- clinical manfiestation in adolescents and adults atypical; leads to delay in diagnosis

### Transmission

- Highly infectious during the initial catarrhal period and 2 weeks of spasmodic cough, and can remain infectious up to 6 wks after
- unprotected or partially protected adults and adolescents may serve as reservoir for the infants
- secondary attack rate: 80%
- adolescents and adults major source of transmission

### Epidemiology

- worldwide occurrence
  - one of top 10 causes of death in infants
  - ~10 million new cases and 400,00 deaths mostly in infants, 90% developing countries
- developed countries:
  - increasing incidence (>28,000 cases in 2013)
  - two peaks in incidence
    - >10 years of age
    - <5 months of age

### Pertussis in US

- 1940s: whole-cell pertussis vaccines come into widespread use in US
- 1976: pertussis incidence reaches a nadir, with only 1,010 cases reported in the US
- 1990s: acellular pertussis vaccines replace whole-cell vaccines in the immunization schedule
- 2004: 25,827 cases of pertussis are reported in the US, largest since 1959
- 2005: Acellular pertussis vaccines are licensed for use in adults and adolescents (tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertusiss [Tdap] vaccine)
- 2010: epidemic of pertussis in California that included 9,154 reported cases, with the highest incidence of disease in infants younger than 6 months, followed by children aged 7-10 years; in the latter age group, disease risk was associated with an increasing interval since the last dose of pertussis-containing vaccine
- 2012: Tdap vaccine administration is recommended during every pregnancy
- 2014: epidemic of pertussis in California that included 9,9535 reported cases

### Duration of protection from vaccination

- whole cell vaccine: 4-14 years
- Acellular vaccine: 5-6 years
- depends on number of doses; >2 needed for protection
- most hospitalized infants have had no or only 1 dose of the vaccine

### Recommendations in 2010

CDPH Tdap recommendation:

- immunize pre-teens, teens, and adults with Tdap
- 7-9 year olds who are underimmunized
- >10 years who have not yet received Tdap, especially:
  - women of childbearing age, preferably before, or else during or immediately after pregnancy
  - others with close contact with young infants
  - includes persons >64 years of age
- reminder to promptly immunize young children with DTaP can start as early as 6 weeks

### Tdap Recommendations from some orgs

CDC/AAP/AAFP/ACOG/ACP

- routine use at 11-12 years of age
- special focus on adults in contact with young infants
  - HCWs
  - parents and siblings
  - pregnant women
  - grandparents
- No defined minimum interval

### New California recommendations

In July, 2011:

- all students going into 7th-12 grades must have proof of having had the Tdap booster

CDC:

- pregnant women, regardless of previous vaccination status (given at 3rd trimester)

### Observations

- in at least 7 statewide pertussis epidemics and multiple more geographically restricted outbreaks, a substantial proportion of cases in certain age groups were unvaccinated or undervaccinated
- at least 7 pertussis outbreaks have been described in highly vaccinated populations, illustrative of waning vaccine-induced immunity
- reasons for non-vaccination are infrequently reported in pertussis outbreaks, however, in 8 outbreaks, between 59-93% of cases were intentionally unvaccinated or undervaccinated
- individuals with vaccine exemptions have a greater risk for pertussis than those who are fully vaxxed
- undervaccinated individuals - those who have received fewwer than the rec number of age-appropriate doses of pertussis-containing vaccine, also have an elevated risk for pertusssis compared with fully vaxxed persons
- schools, communities, and states with higher exemption rates have higher rates of pertussis, including among the fully vaxxed pop
- states with allowances for personal belief exemptions or with easier exemption policies have higher incidence rates of pertussis
