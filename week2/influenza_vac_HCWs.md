# Immunization Practices and Policies

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the arguments for and against mandatory influenza vaccination of HCWs
  - influenza is highly contagious, the vaccine is effective but not as much as we would like, and hospitalized patients are most-likely to have bad outcomes

## Influenza Vaccination and HCWs

- every year, 15,000 to 35,000 die of complications of influenza
  - usually concentrated at health care institutions
  - mandatory vaccinations for HCWs
- Ethical Principles
  - Autonomy vs Beneficence conflict apparent in influenza vaccination
  
Story: debate, Union arguing for autonomy position, that hospitals had no right to force a nurse to get vaccinated for influenza, but the advisory group argued for beneficence (patients shouldn't get sick from influenza, hospital has a duty to prevent)

- Union likely taking strong stance on autonomy due to hospitals pressing on other autonomy issues of employees
- Hospitals under pressure to ensure patients didn't acquire influenza

### Estimated hospitalizations and deaths from influenza, 2011-2015

Many deaths in 2013 and 2015, fewer in 2012 and 2014

### Vaccinations among adults

- people with highest rates of vaccination are 75 and older, then 65-74 and older, drops as you get younger
- influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone

### Approaches to influenza-vaccine production

#### Inactivated vaccines

- egg-based injectable, 3 or 4-valent
- cell-based injectable, 3-valent (ages 18-49)
- with adjuvant: approved in the US in 2016
- intradermal: 3-valent (ages 18-64)
- High dose injectable, egg-based: 3-valent (>64)

#### Live attenuated vaccines

- egg-based: 4-valent (nasal spray; ages 2-49)
- egg-based injectable: 4-valent

### Reasons for declining influenza vaccination in general public

- many of the reasons boil down to thinking that the individual doesn't need it
  - consider themselves healthy
- worry of shortage
- worry of side-effects
- doctor may not have said explicitly

### Vaccine Complications

- Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)
- Egg Allergy
- A previous severe allergic reaction (eggs for influenza)

### Immunization for kids in Connecticut

Mandatory immunization in 2010, dramatic increase after made mandatory

- instance of future hospitalizations for influenza decreased as well

## Should HCWs be vaccinated against influenza?

Experience in Northern California

- unions strongly against
- public health officials strongly in favor of vaccination
- government wouldn't decide, so public health officials mandated it
- despite incentives (free, nearby, extra benefits, etc), vaccination rate amongst nurses was around 60%
- Nurses' union vs Hospitals
- County Public Health Officers issued public health order: Nurses must be immunized or else wear a mask for entirety of the season (Nov-April)

Rates of vaccination now in high 90s for those hospitals/nurses
