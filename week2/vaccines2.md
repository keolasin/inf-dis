# Vaccine Evaluation and Safety Assessment

## Learning Objectives

- List 7 features of an ideal vaccine
- Define vaccine effectiveness vs vaccine efficacy
- be able to calculate vaccine efficacy in a cohort vaccine trial
- be able to calculate vaccine efficacy in a case-control study
- be able to access vaccine safety data from CDC vaccine monitoring sites

## Components of an Ideal Vaccine

- Induces cross-reacting neutralizing antibodies
- Elicits strong and broad CD4+ T cell responses
- Induces cross-clade reactive CD8+ CTL response
- Induces long-term memory
- Be effective as a therapeutic vaccine (e.g., for those with HIV, HBV, HCV, HPV, and M. tuberculosis infections)
    - herpes zoster virus vaccine
- inexpensive
- easy to administer

## Definitions

**Vaccine efficacy**: degree of beneficial result achieved under **ideal** conditions:
    - measured by randomized clinical trials
  
**Vaccine effectiveness**: degree of beneficial result achieved under **real-world** conditions for a defined population
    - measured by observational studies. effectiveness affected by immune system response, vaccine trial study design, host factors, epidemiological factors, environmental factors, etc.

## Vaccine Evaluation

1. Pre-clinical trial evaluation
   - in vitro testing
   - animal studies
2. Clinical Trials
   1. phase 1: designed to assess safety, determine formulation dose, route of delivery
   2. phase 2: deisgned to assess efficacy and safety (efficacy unknown before trial)
   3. phase 3: designed to assess efficacy or effectiveness (efficacy assumed to exist based on phase 2 trial)
3. Post-licensure evaluation (phase 4):
   1. designed to detect adverse events not picked up by earlier phases

### Calculating Vaccine Efficacy (VE)

- In a case-control study:
  - VE = (Iunv - Ivac) / Iunv * 100%
  - where Iunv is the disease incidence among unvaccinated,
  - Ivac is the incidence among vaccinated group
- In a cohort study:
  - VE = 1-RR
  - RR = Ivac/Iunvac

## Vaccine adverse event surveillance systems

Passive surveillance systems:
    - vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS, USA)
    - Canadian Adverse Events Following Immunisation Surveillance System (CAEFISS), Canada)

Sentinel Surveillance Systems
    - vaccine safety datalink (VSD) - uses rapid cycle analysis (RCA) method of data collection
    - New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN)
    - Clinical Immunizations Safety Assessment (CISA)

### VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)

(VAERS)[wwww.vaers.hhs.gov]

- data maintained by CDC (accessible through CDC Wonder)
- Database contains info on unverified reports of adverse events
- contains reports from 1990 onwards
- searchable by many fields

### VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink)

maintained mainly by Kaiser

#### RCA (Rapid Cycle Analysis)

- VSD project team uses RCA to monitor newly licensed vaccines and new vaccine recommendations
- monitors adverse events following vaccination in near real time
- each week, rate of adverse events in a vaccinated group compared to a similar group of people who have not received that vaccine

### NVSN (New Vaccine Surveillance Network)

more of a research surveillance system

- established in 2006, expanded in 2009, that includes research sites
- focus on population-based surveillance and data collection on the use and impact of new vaccines

### CISA (Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment) Network

Established in 2001, studies the pathophysiology of adverse events following immunization (AEFI), identifies risk factors, and provides guidance for doctors
