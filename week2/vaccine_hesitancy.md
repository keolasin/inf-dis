# Vaccine Hesitancy

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to define vaccine hesitancy
- Describe the 5 types of concern that contribute to vaccine hesitancy
- Describe vaccine hesitancy concerns expressed by parents, general public, healthcare providers, public health workers, researchers, schools, gov, politicians, mass media, social networks, and "anti-vaxxers"

## Vaccine-preventable outbreaks

Rubella in Japan, Measles (worldwide)

### History of hesitancy

Benjamin Franklin, parent and an early anti-vaccination campaigner

- after his 4-year-old son died of smallpox:
  - "I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it...the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen."

#### Mumps Cases in US

first vaccine in 1977, more than 150,000 cases prior, decreases to less than 20,000

- some resurgence in the 80's leading to 1989 recommendation
- 1989 2nd dose MMWR ACIP recommendation,
- another outbreak in 2006, then 2009, lead to another CDC recommendation for 3rd vaccine

#### Pertussis Cases in California, 1945-2016

Recently, more cases occurring

- can be due to waning immunity, not necessarily entirely due to vaccine hesitancy or under-utilization

#### Hepatitis A Outbreaks in California

1200 in 2003, down to fewer than 200 in 2011, then back up to 1400 in 2017.

Typically in homeless population, but likely due to under-utilization of vaccine

### what are the concerns?

1. Safety Fear

   - fear that vaccines (and/or their additives) are unsafe (e.g., cause complications, autism, complex regional pain syndrome, etc.)

2. Fear of disease

    - will give the immunized person an infection that the vaccine is supposed to prevent

3. Naturalists

    - getting the "natural" disease is healthier

4. Antigen Overload

    - Too many vaccines at one visit "overload" the immune system

5. Belief System Violation

    - Religious belief, personal belief, individual choice

## Under-vaccination in USA

1. Intentional under-vaccination: vaccine skeptics ("anti-vaxxers")
   1. typically white, higher education, higher SES
2. Unintentional under-vaccination
   1. lack of knowledge and poor access to info
   2. social and economic inequalities
      1. access to quality health care
      2. cost
      3. insurance

## Childhood and Adolescent vaccines

Concerned people, groups, organizations

- parents
- general public
- health care providers
- public health orgs
- scientific community (vaccine researchers)
- schools
- government
- politicians
- mass media
- anti-vaccine groups
- internet-based social networks
  
## Definition of Vaccine Hesitancy

SAGE Definition, A behavior influenced by:

- confidence (distrust of vaccine or provider)
- complacency (vaccine not necessary)
- convenience (access)
- heterogenous group with varying degrees of indecision about specific vaccines or vaccines in general

### 5 groups of vaccine-hesitant parents

1. uninformed but educatable: seek info to counter an anti-vax message
2. misinformed but correctable: not fully aware of the benefits of vaccines 
3. well-read and open-minded: explored both sides and want to draw context-appropriate conclusion
4. convinced and contented: strongly vaccine hesitant but willing to listen to the other side
5. committed and missionary: want to convince the provider to agree wiht their arguments against vaccination

#### Effective messaging for skeptic-parents

Systematic review of interventions to reduce parental vaccine refusal and hesitancy:

- 30 studies
- interventions: state laws, school-based laws, parent-centered education
- results: mixed
- "There is limited evidence to guide implementation of effective strategies to deal with the emerging threat of parental vacine refusal"

Surveys - parent attitudes about childhood vaccines

- 364 surveys of parents of adolescents 11-17
  - vaccine coverage for HPV: 45%
  - concern about vaccine efficacy: 39%
  - concern about safety: 41%
  - concern about receiving all the vaccines due at one visit: 45%
  - **Any two of above concerns associated with vaccine refusal**
  - overall PACV score not predictive of vaccine uptake by a teenager at visit

### General Public

- no experience or observation of vaccine-preventable diseases by a large segment of the general public (who has seen someone paralyzed with polio?)
- inability to differentiate personal benefit vs public benefit (beneficence)
- invisibility of public health programs (hard to gauge benefit, easier to see impact when a problem is ameloriated)
  - we don't really see the products of effective public health programs
- distrust or poor image of public health
- lack of interest in public health
  - poorly funded by taxpayers
  - no "awareness ribbons" for public health
    - ribbon for vaccine ribbon, but not one in support of vaccines

### Health Care Providers

Issues this pop deals with:

- too busy
- inadequate compensation for providing vaccine
- uncertainty about how to talk to parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids
- feeling of inadequacy

Examples with HPV:

- HPV vaccine is often presented as optional, whereas other adolescent vaccines are recommended
- some expressed mixed or negative opinions about the new vaccine and conerns over safety/efficacy
- when parents expressed reluctance providers were hesitant to engage in discussion
- some providers shared parents views that teen was not at risk for HPV and could delay vaccination until older

Greatest influence on parent's decision to immunize his/her child is the child's health-care provider (HCP):

- establish non-confrontational dialogue with parents
- listen to parent's concern
- ask parents to specifically describe their concerns
- identify parents' specific beliefs
- give personal experiences with vaccine-preventable diseases as well as religious or cultural beliefs

### Public Health Organizations

- underfunded (e.g., FETP-J), politically affected
- poor communication with the general public and health-care providers
- conflicting priorities (Ebola vs vaccination?)
  - do we shift funds from ebola intervention to a vaccine program?
- jurisdictional vaccination program differences
- tip-sheet for talking to parents: CDC for-hcp-tipsheet-hpv site

#### Role of public health orgs in addressing vaccine benefit and safety concerns

1. Establish surveillance system to detect outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases
   1. USA: included in National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)
   2. state and local systesms
2. Standing team to investigate outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases
   1. Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS)
3. Establish surveillance system to detect adverse event
   1. Passive surveillance system sensitive enough to detect signal to generate an hypothesis
      1. US vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS)
   2. Sentinel, active surveillance system that allows hypothesis testing
      1. US: Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD); New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN)
4. Standing team to conduct investigation of AE
   1. vaccine-related adverse events: NVSN

### Vaccine Researchers

- inability to communicate with the general public
- scientific info/terminologies confusing to parents
- HPV vaccine: inability to demonstrate protection against cervical cancer
  - introduced in 2006, but takes many years for vaccine to show effectiveness against cervical CA since cervical CA takes many years to develop (20-30 years to develop)
- Slow response to false info or "bad" science
  - Wakefield Lancet Paper (1988)
  - Lancet retraction of Wakefield Lcanet Paper (2000)

### Schools

- HPV Vaccination requirement for school entry, USA, 2014
  - 29 states have no laws
- personal and religious exemptions allowed in some states
  - July 2015, California no longer allows personal belief or religious exemptions (following measles outbreaks)
- Minors >12 can consent to HPV vaccine without parents' permission
- school-based vaccination program greatly increases coverage

### Government

Responsible for legislating vaccine financing:

- private financing
  - private insurance coverage of HPV
- public financing
  - vaccines for children program (VFC)
  - immunization grant program through CDC
  - Medicaid
  - Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), state level

### Politicians

- Social-conservative politicians argue HPV vaccine encourages promiscuity
- government intervention vs personal/private decision
- Texas Governor Rick Perry's executive order madating HPV vaccine for school-age girls in Texas, 2007: overturned by state legistlature right away
- 2015 Republican presidential candidates debate: 2 physicians (Ron Paul, Ben Carson) did not directly refute the belief that vaccines caused autism
- Can politicians be educated?

### Mass Media

- Important and factual message not obvious to the media
- Focuses more on perceived vaccine dangers and emotional issues than benefits of vaccines (sensationalism)
- highglights unusual controversies and events (news)
  - examples: now discredited Lancet paper linking MMR vaccine to autism in 12 children
  - Michele Bachmann's speech in 2011 saying HPV caused mental retardation
- time constratint to convey scientific knowledge understandably (sound bites, images)
- few trained in conveying scientific or epi knowledge

### Anti-vaccine Groups

Arguments:

1. Vaccines cause autism
2. Contain mercury that poison the body
3. Diseases like measles aren't all that bad
4. many children are injured by vaccines
5. there is no guarantee that vaccines work
6. too many vaccines given at once can overwhelm the immune system

### Internet-based social networks

- Too much info from too many sources
- how to separate facts from fiction
- how to distinguish reliable sources form agenda-based sources
