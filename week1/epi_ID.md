# Basic Epidemiologic Concepts in Infectious Diseases

## Learning Objectives

- define epi as applied to epi diseases
- name 7 components of epi of infectious diseases
- describe 3 types of occurence of infectious diseases
- name 3 major examples of reservoir and pathogens associated with those reservoirs
- list 10 modes of transmission of infectious diseases
- describe 5 different settings that facilitate infectious disease transmission
- describe 5 pathogen-related factors that affect transmission
- describe 5 host-related factors that affect transmission
- describe 8 environmental factors that affect transmission

## Definitions

Epidemiology of infectious disease: study of distribution and determinants of distribution of diseases caused by infectious agents.

### Components of infectious disease epi concepts

1. disease occurence
2. reservoir
3. modes of transmission
4. setting of disease transmission
5. Microbial factors that influence transmission
6. Host factors that influence transmission
7. Environmental factors that influence transmission

### Disease occurence

1. Outbreak: occurrence of disease at a particular setting/site at levels above what is expected for that place and time
2. Epidemic: occurrence of disease at multiple settings/sites in a large geographic area at levels above what is expected with respect to place and time
3. Endemic: occurrence of disease with no apparent fluctuation with respect to place and time
4. Pandemic: epidemic encompassing a large geographic area, spanning multiple countries or continents.

### What constitutes an epidemic?

Case of cholera in Louisiana, 1901-2010. In 1979, observed an outbreak (single case). Counts as an epidemic!

Example: Shigellosis in New Delhi, India, 1985-1995

Endemic disease, roughly average case load every year. But, if we imagine double the cases in a single year (1990), we would say this is an outbreak/epidemic.

### Reservoir

location in which a microbial organism is normally found; the natural habitat of an organism (where it establishes, metabolizes, and replicates)

Examples of reservoirs:

- human host as sole reservoir: Salmonella typhi, Shigella, HIV, Plasmodium falciparum
- animals as reservoir: Salmonella enteritidis, E. coli, 0157:H7, Listeria
- Environment as reservoir: Vibrio cholerae in estuaries

### Modes of transmission (Diarrhea example)

1. Person-to-person

- fecal-oral
- other secretions (oral)
- others (transplacental, perinatal)

2. Foodborne
3. Waterborne
4. Airborne
5. Fomites
6. Vector-borne (arthropod)
7. Blood/blood products
8. Organ transplants

### Settings of disease transmission

1. Community
2. Family
3. Nosocomial (hospital)
4. Other institutional settings (school, day-care, military barracks, nursing home, chronic care facility)
5. Miscellaneous (religious gatherings, camps, food distribution systems, international travel)

### Pathogen-specific factors that influence transmission

- Infectious dose or inoculum 
- route of infection (Example E. coli, injected into blood would be fatal, whereas living in the gut is okay)
- Virulence property of an organism
- Defense property of an organism
- Drug resistance

### Host-specific factors that influence disease transmission or disease manifestation

- age, gender, ethnic background
- immunity (innate, acquired)
- underlying illness, malnutrition, AIDs
- drug exposure (antibiotics, antacids, immunosuppresive agents)
- Risk behavior, cultural practices

### Environment-specific factors that influence transmission or disease manifestation

- Geography
    - "tropical" diseases
    - location of animal reservoirs or vectors
- Weather
    - natural weather cycles (seasonality)
    - new weather patterns (El Nino, greenhouse effect)
    - Climate change - long-term effects
- Disasters
    - natural, man-made
- Industrialization, man-made changes, antibiotic exposures
- Technology
- Population size and urbanization, slum settlements
- Socioeconomic factors: poverty, breakdown in public health infrastructure
