# Intro to Infectious Diseases, Core Concepts

## Learning objectives

- Understand how the convergence model of the host-parasite interaction differs from the traditional model.
- Know what is meant by the notion that, from the perspective of infectious diseases, we live in two worlds.
- Understand the significance of and reasons for pathogen emergence and reemergence.
- Know why zoonotic infections are an important source of human infections.
- Think about the role of our microbiome in health and disease
- Give examples of how males and females differ in their response to infectious agents.

## Wither Infectious Diseases?

Are we really at the cusp of eliminating inf-diseases as a problem, or are we at their mercy?

In 1950s, thought that infectious diseases would no longer be a problem soon.

## The Host-Microbe Relationship

Hippocratic - Hellenic Model, an ancient model of infectious disease and humor imbalances

Updated Model - host/parasite model

Three events occur when the host/parasite interact:

1. Colonize
    - parasite lives on host continuously
2. Covert
    - parasite has penetrated into the host but don't result in disease
3. Overt
    - results in disease

Modern Model incorporates a public health perspective:

### Convergence Model

Varying interlocking domains that intervene and influence the host-parasite interaction

- physical environmental factors
- genetic and biologic factors
- microbe
- humans (hosts)
- ecologic factors
- social, political, and economic factors

## Global Causes of Death

Ischemic Heart Disease number 1, Stroke 2 (CVDs)
COPDs, respiratory diseases next

Global Causes of Death vary based on the community we look at - when we look at a HIC (high income country), the first infectious disease is only #6 (lower respiratory)

But, looking at a LIC/LMIC, the 3 leading causes of death *are* infectious diseases.

## Infectious Diseases in 20th Century

1918 Influenza Pandemic, but otherwise declining steadily since 1922. In 1980, began to reverse and increase.

- All cause mortality decreasing steadily
- Infectious disease mortality decreasing steadily
- Non-infectious disease mortality increasing
