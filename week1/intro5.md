# Themes to consider

1. Are all diseases infectious?

- some evidence for MS, arthritis being linked to infection
- type 1 DM can be precipitated by B4 tay-sacche virus

2. How do the survival strategies of organisms relate to the epidemiology of disease?

- why do we cough with respiratory infections?

3. What role do our genes play in susceptibility to infectious diseases?

interleukin 2 response, different polymorphisms can change the response to interleukin 2

4. What is the effect of our built environment on the infectious diseases we experience?

- Legionnaires disease with high-rises, lyme disease in suburban environments, hospital acquired infections

5. What will be the effect of climate change?

- Seeing the effect on vectors (mosquitos, ticks)
- what foods/animals should we try to avoid?
- what behaviors are dangerous?

6. What foods, behaviors, and animals should we avoid?

7. Wither infectious diseases?

8. Where are lacunae in our current paradigm of the host-microbe relationship?

9. What impact will gene drive-modified organisms have on the future of infectious diseases?

10. Why do we experience disease from infection?

11. How successful have public health interventions been?

- fluoridation for teeth, family planning, STI/STD interventions, tobacco cessation, infectious disease vaccinations
- HPV, influenza, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs

12. Why don't we invest more in public health?

- why does the US invest so little in public health while investing so much in healthcare?
- does the private sector make money on public health?
