# Framework and Rubrics for Evaluating Infectious Diseases

## Learning Objectives

Create a rubric to help organize thinking about infectious agents and diseases.

- understand the vocab
- know the difference between primary and opportunistic pathogens
- understand the distinction between infection and disease.

## General Outline of Lectures

1. Etiology
2. Epidemiology

- occurrence
- reservoir
- transmission
- temporal pattern
- communicability

3. Pathogenesis
4. Clinical
5. Diagnosis
6. Treatment
7. Prevention

## Terminology

### Symbiosis

"Living together," the ecological relationship between organisms of different species that are in direct contact.

- any time there is an interaction between a host and parasite, that's a symbiotic relationship.
- if one is much larger than the other, the larger is the host, the smaller is the parasite

Types of symbiosis:

1. Parasitism

- typically benefits the parasite more, while harming host, and moderately dependent
- "besides the food", a type of predation, the parasite lives at the expense of the host

2. Commensalism

- "one who eats at the same table"
- typically little harm, mostly independent, with more benefit to both
- lives with the host without helping or harming either way
- generally reflects our lack of knowledge, or non-commital attitude, of the contributions of our microbiome
    - we might just not know the interaction fully to determine harm/benefit

3. Mutualism

- typically little harm, very dependent, with more benefit to both
- more common than we thought

### Pathogens

Pathos = suffer, any microorganism whose survival depends on its capacity to replicate and persist on or within another species, by actively destroying or breaching a cellular or humeral host barrier that normally inhibits or restricts microorganisms.

A pathogen is an organism who needs to survive by getting into the host system, where the host system would typically destroy/restrict it.

Pathogens fall into two basic types:

1. **Primary Pathogens**:

- when introduced to human hosts, almost always make the human host sick with exposure.
- not necessarily influenza, mortality rates only 2-4%, and 1 in 3 exposed actually became sick.
- Measles is a primary pathogen, if you're unvaccinated, become exposed, you'll get sick.
- Similar with varicella (chicken pox), exposure = disease.
- Smallpox also a primary pathogen

2. **Opportunistic Pathogens**

- organisms that cause disease rarely in a normal host, but cause disease in injured or compromised hosts.
- Cytomegalo virus, only devastating for those with AIDs
- Latent tuberculosis

#### Distinguishing Features

Able to gain access to distinguished niches that aren't available to commensal species

- For a pathogen to cause disease, it has to get into the host, subvert the host defenses, be able to survive/replicate in the host.

**Virulence factors**: ability to cause disease in the host

### Modalities of Disease Causation

What are the virulence qualities that allow for disease to occur?

- botulism, infectious bacteria, has no ability to invade our bodies, but it does produce a toxin that can kill us.
- Tetanus caused by an anaerobic organism, can't invade, but produces a toxin that is lethal (intoxication)

Intoxication vs Invasiveness

- Diptheria, staphylococcus, pneumococcus, strep, tuberculosis are more invasive and able to invade the host system, resulting in disease.
- Host response can vary

### Infection and Infectious Diseases

**Exposure** - when you initial are exposed to the organism
**Infection** - possessing the disease, not necessarily sick from the disease
**Latency** - the organism is still in the host body, but not causing disease
**Disease** - the state when host damage occurs, which can be significant enough to disturb the host homeostasis
**Communicability** - when the disease can be transmitted from person-person or host to others
**Convalescence** - The recovery period from the disease.
