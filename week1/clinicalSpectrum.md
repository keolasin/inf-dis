# Clinical Spectrum

## Learning objectives

- Distinguish categories of agents of infectious disease
- Differentiate asymptomatic vs symptomatic infection
- Name the four stages of a natural course of an infection after exposure to an infectious agent
- Name 3 pathogen factors that influence disease manifestation after exposure to an infectious agent
- Name 3 host factors that influence disease manifestation after exposure to an infectious agent

## Categories of infectious agents

### Communicable vs non-communicable

1. Communicable agents: acquired by person-to-person, or animal-to-person transmission 

- Examples: Salmonella, HIV, M. tuberculosis, Plasmodium spp, etc.)

2. Non-communicable agents: acquired by exposures to reservoirs where pathogens reside

- Examples: Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium tetani, Vibrio cholerae, etc.

### Pathovar vs non-pathovar

1. Pathovar: pathogenic variant of an infectious agent belonging to the same species that occur as commensal or saprophyte:

- commensal organisms: microbes that are naturally found in certain parts of the body, don't typically do anything in healthy individuals
- saprophyte: bacterial organisms that survive on dead organic matter, prat of the environment
- Examples: E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Entamoeba histolytica

2. Non-pathovar: commensal or saprophytic organism that does not cause disease in *immunocompetent* hosts

### Disease vs infection

1. Infection: colonization by an organism of a host with or without producing clinically-overt symptoms

- symptomatic infection
- asymptomatic infection
    - latent infection: does not cause transmission
    - chronic infection: opportunity for transmission

2. Disease: state of having clinically-overt symptoms with an infection

#### Consequences after exposure to an infectious agent

1. Incubation Period (minutes to years): period between the exposure and the first manifestation of clinically-overt symptoms

2. Asymptomatic infection

- with opportunity for transmission
- without opportunity for transmission

3. Symptomatic infection (disease)

Outcomes:

- Spontaneous clearance of infection
- Complication and sequelae
- Carriage:
    - convalescent or,
    - chronic carriage (1yr or more)
- Latent infection
- Acquisition of immunity

### Natural course of an infection after exposure

1. Acute

- incubation period, symptomatic disease, convalescent period (or carriage period), then immune period.

2. Chronic

- With chronic diseases, the incubation period can last months to years, spontaneous clearance may occur, then symptomatic disease, then convalescent period, then carriage/immune periods

### Factors that influence disease outcomes after exposure

- Microbial factors:
    - infectious inoculum size
    - vehicles of infectious agent (e.g., milk acting as a buffer and allowing bacteria to grow vs water)
    - virulence characteristics of the microbe

- Host factors:
    - pre-existing host immunity and resistance:
        - innate resistance (age, gender, microbiota)
        - previous infection
        - genetic predisposition (example: genetic resistance to malaria, but susceptible to salmonella)
    - acquired host factors:
        - underlying medical conditions
        - medications
        - vaccination status
