# The Microbiome

- Evolving paradigms
- Moving from Spenserian thinking to ecological thinking
- who parasitizes whom?
    number of cells that are uniquely human vastly outnumbered by cells that are bacterial or viral
- who manipulates whom?
    bacteria and viruses can affect human behavior

- humans as newcomers to interacting with microbial world

- not as diverse as it once was

## Where does the microbiome come from?

- Comes at the time of birth - many species may even be in the placenta, vaginal canal which are then transmitted to the newborn
- Breastfeeding helps introduce more
- Food sources
- Environment (pets, parents, siblings)
- Within 2-3 years, our microbiome is well established

## Mutualism

If you were introduced to a totally sterile environment, you would not survive

- necessary to survival to interact with the microbiome
- Vitamin K
- breakdown of xenobiotics
- cholesterol and steroid synthesis
- integrity of the GI mucosa
- immune development and modulation
- energy

## What alters the microbiome?

- antibiotics
- fewer siblings
- cleaner homes
- safer food and water
- more c-sections
- formula feeding

## Diseases/conditions linked to our microbiome

- chronic periodontisis
- MDRO colonization
- preterm birth
- neuropsych illness
- autoimmune diseases
- cancer
- H. pylori
- obesity

## Vaccination

Conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, now seeing other strains of pneumonia than were vaccinated for

- how to restore the microbiome

## Sex differences and infections

- exposures
- biological
- autoimmunity

specific diseases:

- hep C less severe in women
- HIV, women have 40% lower loads and CD4, but experience greater inflammation than men
- influenza: significantly increased mortality rates in pregnant women
- tuberculosis: more men than women have TB globally
- anemic liver abscess, mostly in men, especially in Mexico
