# Emerging and Re-emerging diseases

## "New" Infectious Diseases

Historical Perspective

- various plagues, 
    - Athens, 
    - Gathenian, 
    - Bubonic plagues (reduced population by 1/4)
- Syphilis
- Influenza
- Malaria

Why do new infectious diseases begin?

- newly discovered or introduced
- some are just being recognized as an infectious disease
- pathogens can be very difficult to identify
    - legionnaire's disease in philadelphia (pneumonia) took a long time to identify (recognized in 1976, but realized in 1920s, 30s)
- introduction of disease to a non-immune population
    - example of colonizers going to America, ravaging the native populations
- new or evolved organisms
    - HIV1 evolved from HIV2
    - methacillin-stephalococceos
    - SARs

### Necessary events for pathogen emergence

System diagram of disease increase

Population size - humans can only sustain measles after a certain population size, otherwise it typically lives in other host species

1 billion earning <$1/day, 850 million people experiencing hunger, 140 million experiencing dire malnutrition, 1-2 billion undernourished, Urbanization increasing.
