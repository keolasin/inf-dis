# Etiology of Infectious Disease

Causes of Infectious Disease

## Learning Objectives

- describe the steps used to classify microbes that cause disease
- name the 5 categories of infectious agents
- describe key features that differentiate the 5 categories of infectious agents
- describe 5 ways in which microbes can be taxonomically classified
- describe the key features that differentiate the two major groups of bacteria
- describe ways in which bacteria exchange genetic materials, and why these processes are important for infectious disease
- name 3 general mechanisms by which bacteria produce disease

## Laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases - microbe

Microbial population in a "sterile" niche - makes it relatively easier to identify the cause

- caveat: things we previously thought were fairly sterile, actually turn out not to be as sterile as believed
- can obtain a pure culture

A non-sterile environment: need to separate the pathogen of interest from the other microbes in that niche, to obtain the pure culture

Next, subject the pure culture to varying tests to identify the species of the microbe

## Classifications of microbes

1. Identification: practical use of a classification method to isolate and distinguish desirable organisms from undesirable ones
2. Taxonomy: science of classifying organisms, according to:
    1. morphologic characteristics
    2. growth
    3. staining
    4. biochemical
    5. microscopic
    6. serological
    7. genetic characteristics

### Microbiology and taxonomy

- Classification of infectious agents:

    - bacteria
    - viruses
    - fungi
    - parasites 
        - protozoans (giardia)
        - helminths (roundworms)
    - prions (no nucleic acid, just a protein)

### Morpholic differences

|                 | bacteria | viruses | fungi | parasites | prions |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| nucleus         | no       | no      | yes   | yes       | no     |
| cell wall       | yes      | no      | yes   | no        | no     |
| plasma membrane | yes      | no      | yes   | yes       | no     |
| cell organelles | no       | no      | yes   | yes       | no     |

- Viruses do possess nucleic acids
- Prions are just proteins with certain structural proteins that can cause similar structural changes in other normal proteins

### Colony Morphology

- MacConkey agar: Red colonies indicate fermentation of lactose by the bacteria - makes lactic acid, that causes substrate to turn red.
    - quick way to isolate gram-negative bacteria

### Bacterial grouping by cell wall staining properties

Gram stain (crystophylate) can stain the peptidoglycan, it will remain bound in the thicker layer.

Next, counter stain using safronin, which cannot stain the previously stained gram positive bacteria, but will stain the gram-negative bacteria

#### Gram Negative

- thickness of the peptidoglycan layer is *thin*
- have two membranes (outer and inner/plasma membrane)

#### Gram Positive

- only has one plasman membrane
- thicker peptidoglycan layer *thick*

#### Acid Fast Bacillus

usually used for microbacterial organisms

- Stains the mycolic acid layer, then when later trying to treat that layer, in most bacteria, the initial red dye gets removed.
- but in mycolic bacteria, it fixes the dye, and the stain remains

### Biochemical Properties

1. Triple Sugar-iron test
    - frequently used to identify enteric bacteria like shigella or salmonella
    - various colors indicate different fermentations of sugar in the test
    - depending what the bacteria produced to ferment those sugars, the pH sensitive dye will indicate certain acid fermentations (from red to yellow)
    - Hydrogen gas production occurs
2. API-20E
    - larger panel of biochemical tests/substrates

### Light Microscopy

- gram staining, electron microscopy
- staphylococcus aureus (grape-like, round)

E. coli, gram-negative (stains pink), has a rod-shape

### Fungi

Yeast vs Hyphae form

- Yeast is round, hyphae branches

### Serologic Tests

Salmonella, a gram-negative bacteria, can be further sub-typed according to a serologic test

- typhoid fever, a sero-type of salmonella (more than 2000 serotypes of salmonella)

Serogrouping-O: based on the O-polysaccharide antigens, the type of antibody response (O antigens)
Serotyping: antibody responses to polysaccharide and flagella structure (H) antigens

Both depend on the type of antibodies produced (O or H)

#### How are serologic tests used in public health?

- helps to classify microbes for surveillance purposes
- helps with outbreak detection and sources of outbreaks
- helps to monitor effect of an intervention

### Genetic classification of microbes

Electrophoresis-based methods ("fingerprinting")

- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
- PCR-generated bands
- pulsed field gel electrophoresis

Nucleic acid sequence-based methods

#### IS6110 RFLP analysis of M. tuberculosis

IS6110 cuts at certain site, generates many fragments, some of those fragments will contain IS6110 and show up on RFLP as dark staining

#### Genetic classification of microbes relevance to public health

- mutations and their effect on phenotype (drug resistance, pathogenicity)
- vaccine development
- surveillance of infectious disease based on genotypes (e.g., PulseNet, CDC)
- hospital epidemiology

### Molecular basis of pathogenesis

- cell attachment, invasion, cell death
- recognized virulence determinants: plasmids, phages, pathogenicity islands, secretion systems
- mechanisms of resistance to host's antimicrobial effector molecules
- host subversion, molecular mimicry
- establishment of latency/persistance
